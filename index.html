        The Most Famous Number
      </h4>
      <p>
        People immediately recognize 666 as "the number of the beast." But what is the beast,
        and why does it have a number? And why is its number so famous? The number of the beast is one of the most
        intriguing parts of Jesus' prophecy recorded within the book of Revelation. The verse describing
        the number reveals that it is the number of a man, so who is this man?
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Revelation 13:18 - "This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the
          number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666."
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The man whose number is 666 is often referred to as the Antichrist or the man of lawlessness.
        Paul the Apostle described the Antichrist's reign, which must take place before Jesus' return:
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 - "Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes
          first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction, who opposes and exalts
          himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple
          of God, proclaiming himself to be God."
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bible provides multiple details about the Antichrist that open the door for us to identify him in advance, so
        in that spirit, let's walk through some criteria and see if we can make a compelling case
        that someone currently alive fits the bill.

        Biblical Descriptions of the Beast
      </h4>
      <p>
        Revelation and Daniel portray the Antichrist as a beast, but with quite different imagery:
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Revelation 13:2 - "And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth
          was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority."
        <br><br>
        Daniel 7:8 - "...there came up before them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns
          were plucked up by the roots. And behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking
          great things."
      </p>
      <p>
        Observe how Prince Charles of Wales' official Coat of Arms contains all this imagery to the detail:
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="CharlesCoatOfArms.png" alt="Prince Charles Coat of Arms" width="350" height="400">
      </div>
      <p>
        On the left we see a beast that looks <i>like a leopard</i>, has <i>feet like a bear's</i>,
        and has a mouth <i>like a lion's mouth.</i> Looking at the beast on the right we see a <i>little horn</i>,
        before which are <i>three horns plucked by up the roots.</i>
        And it has <i>eyes like the eyes of a man,</i> i.e., there are whites in its eyes unlike
        the eyes of a horse which are all dark.
        And its mouth is open and its tongue is out, so it appears to be <i>speaking great things.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This Coat of Arms also features the <i>"great red dragon"</i> (Rev. 12:3) which symbolizes Satan and gives
        the beast <i>his power and his throne and great authority.</i>
        <h4 class="d-flex">
          Calculating the Number of the Beast
        </h4>
      <p>
        People like to come up with their own personal method by which to derive the number 666 from whomever they
        claim to be the Antichrist. However, when Rev. 13:18 was written, a person reading it would likely understand
        it to be referring to the practice of summing all the letters (representing numbers) in someone's name.
      </p>
      <p>
        In ancient Hebrew and Greek, each character of the alphabet had a corresponding number. And in
        a practice called Gematria, the Hebrew characters in a word or phrase would be added together to produce a number. Greek had a
        similar system, called isopsephy, a famous example of which is the ancient graffiti found in Pompeii reading
        "I love her whose number is 545." So to calculate the "number of a man" in these times, one would sum
        all the letters (representing numbers) in the name. Note that in the preterist fulfillment of Revelation,
        the Antichrist, Nero Caesar, had a name that calculated to 666 via Gematria when transliterated into Hebrew.
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="HebrewTranslation.png" alt="Hebrew Translation" width="350" height="100">
      </div>
      <p>
        Above you can see a transliteration of "Charles Prince of Wales" into Hebrew.
        And by all means copy the Hebrew (below) and paste it into an online translator to confirm for yourself
        that this transliteration is valid:
        <br>
        צרלס נסיכ מוליס
        </br>
      </p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <img src="NumberCalculation.png" alt="666 Calculation" width="350" height="400">
      </div>
      <p>
        Not only does "Charles Prince of Wales," (the Prince's official title by which he is known around the
        world) compute to 666 using the original Hebrew system, it does so in English as well. And Prince Charles
        doesn't have a last name due to his status as a high-ranking royal, so it makes sense to use his official
        title for the calculation.

        The Abomination That Makes Desolate
      </h4>
      <p>
        Jesus warned that the great tribulation will elapse after people see "the abomination of desolation spoken
        of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place" (Matt 24:15). This abomination is referred to in
        Revelation as the "image of the beast." Life is breathed into the image by the false prophet, and the
        image causes everyone that will not worship it to be slain (Rev 13:15).
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2002, while trekking through Brazilian rain forests, Prince Charles was presented with a miniature
        version of a statue that could be a mock-up of what will be the abomination that makes desolate.
        It depicts him as an angelic figure with huge wings, standing on a mass of human bodies that are looking up
        to him as their savior. The inscription on the statue's base reads "Saviour of the World" (British spelling of
        savior). But instead of denouncing the statue as blasphemous when he saw it (Jesus is the only Savior of the
        world), Prince Charles said he was "amazed" and "deeply touched" and gave permission for the Brazilian Officials
        to create the larger version.
